The English Wikipedia is the English-language edition of the free online encyclo
pedia Wikipedia. Founded on 15 January 2001, it is the first edition of Wikipedi
a and, as of November 2017, has the most articles of any of the editions.[2] As 
of February 2019, 12% of articles in all Wikipedias belong to the English-langua
ge edition. This share has gradually declined from more than 50 percent in 2003,
 due to the growth of Wikipedias in other languages.[3] As of 21 February 2019, 
there are 5,809,429 articles on the site,[4] having surpassed the 5 million mark
 on 1 November 2015.[5] In October 2015, the combined text of the English Wikipe
dia's articles totalled 11.5 gigabytes when compressed.[6]

The Simple English Wikipedia is a variation in which most of the articles use on
ly basic English vocabulary. There is also the Old English (Ænglisc/Anglo-Saxon)
 Wikipedia (angwiki). Community-produced news publications include The Signpost.

Pioneering edition
See also: Wikipedia:Milestones

The English Wikipedia was the first Wikipedia edition and has remained the large
st. It has pioneered many ideas as conventions, policies or features which were 
later adopted by Wikipedia editions in some of the other languages. These ideas 
include "featured articles",[8] the neutral-point-of-view policy,[9] navigation 
templates,[10] the sorting of short "stub" articles into sub-categories,[11] dis
pute resolution mechanisms such as mediation and arbitration,[12] and weekly col
laborations.[13]

The English Wikipedia has adopted features from Wikipedias in other languages. T
hese features include verified revisions from the German Wikipedia (dewiki) and 
town population-lookup templates from the Dutch Wikipedia (nlwiki).

Although the English Wikipedia stores images and audio files, as well as text fi
les, many of the images have been moved to Wikimedia Commons with the same name,
 as passed-through files. However, the English Wikipedia also has fair-use image
s and audio/video files (with copyright restrictions), most of which are not all
owed on Commons.

Many of the most active participants in the Wikimedia Foundation, and the develo
pers of the MediaWiki software that powers Wikipedia, are English users.

The English Wikipedia reached 4,000,000 registered user accounts on 1 April 2007
,[14] just a little over a year since it had crossed a threshold of 1,000,000 re
gistered user accounts in late February 2006.[15]

Over 800,000 editors have edited Wikipedia more than 10 times.[16] 300,000 edito
rs edit Wikipedia every month;[citation needed] of these, over 30,000 perform mo
re than 5 edits per month, and a little over 3,000 perform more than 100 edits p
er month.[17] By 24 November 2011, a total of 500 million edits had been perform
ed on the English Wikipedia.[citation needed]

As the largest Wikipedia edition, and because English is such a widely used lang
uage, the English Wikipedia draws many users and editors whose native language i
s not English. Such users may seek information from the English Wikipedia rather
 than the Wikipedia of their native language because the English Wikipedia tends
 to contain more information about general subjects. Successful collaborations h
ave been developed between non-native English speakers who successfully add cont
ent to the English Wikipedia and native English speakers who act as copyeditors 
for them.[citation needed]
Arbitration committee
Main article: Arbitration Committee

The English Wikipedia has an arbitration committee (also known as ArbCom) that c
onsists of a panel of editors that imposes binding rulings with regard to disput
es between other editors of the online encyclopedia.[18] The committee was creat
ed by Jimmy Wales on 4 December 2003 as an extension of the decision-making powe
r he had formerly held as owner of the site.[19][20]

When initially founded, the committee consisted of 12 arbitrators divided into t
hree groups of four members each.[19][21] Since then, the committee has graduall
y expanded its membership to 18 arbitrators.[22][not in citation given]

As with other aspects of the English Wikipedia, some of Wikipedia's sister proje
cts have emulated the arbitration committee with their own similar versions.[23]
 For instance, in 2007, an arbitration committee was founded on the German Wikip
edia called the Schiedsgericht [de].[24]

Threats against high schools

Several incidents of threats of violence against high schools on Wikipedia have 
been reported in the mainstream press.[25][26][27] The Glen A. Wilson High Schoo
l was the subject of such a threat in 2008,[25][26][27] and a 14-year-old was ar
rested for making a threat against Niles West High School on Wikipedia in 2006.[

Disputed articles

A 2013 study from Oxford University concluded that the most disputed articles on
 the English Wikipedia tended to be broader issues, while on other language Wiki
pedias the most disputed articles tended to be regional issues; this is due to t
he English language's status as a global lingua franca, which means that many wh
o edit the English Wikipedia do not speak English as a native language.[clarific

Disputed articles

A 2013 study from Oxford University concluded that the most disputed articles on the English Wikipedia tended to be broader issues, while on o
ther language Wikipedias the most disputed articles tended to be regional issues; this is due to the English language's status as a global lin
gua franca, which means that many who edit the English Wikipedia do not speak English as a native language.[clarification needed] The study st
ated that the most disputed entries on the English Wikipedia were: George W. Bush, anarchism, Muhammad, list of WWE personnel, global warming,
 circumcision, United States, Jesus, race and intelligence, and Christianity.[29]
Varieties of English

One controversy in the English Wikipedia concerns which national variety of the English language is to be preferred, with the most commonly ad
vocated candidates being American English and British English.[30] Perennial suggestions range from standardizing upon a single form of Englis
h to forking the English Wikipedia project. A style guideline states, "the English Wikipedia has no general preference for a major national va
riety of the language" and "an article on a topic that has strong ties to a particular English-speaking nation uses the appropriate variety of
 English for that nation".[31] An article should use spelling and grammar variants consistently; for example, color and colour are not to be u
sed in the same article, since they represent American and British English, respectively. The guide also states that an article must remain in
 its original national variant.

There has been a similar issue in the Chinese-language Wikipedia concerning regional differences in writing. Efforts toward a language fork fo
r Portuguese Wikipedia have failed, but those regarding Norwegian Wikipedia succeeded.

Andrew Lih wrote that the English Wikipedia "didn't have the chance to go through a debate over whether there should be a British English Wiki
pedia or an American English Wikipedia" because the English Wikipedia was the original edition.[32][clarification needed] Editors agreed to us
e U.S. spellings for primarily American topics and British spellings for primarily British topics. In 2009 Lih wrote, "No doubt, American spel
lings tend to dominate by default just because of sheer numbers."[33]
Wikiprojects, and assessments of articles' importance and quality
Main article: WikiProject

A "WikiProject" is a group of contributors who want to work together as a team to improve Wikipedia. These groups often focus on a specific to
pic area (for example, women's history), a specific location or a specific kind of task (for example, checking newly created pages). The Engli
sh Wikipedia currently has over 2,000 WikiProjects and activity varies.[34]

In 2007, in preparation for producing a print version, the English Wikipedia introduced an assessment scale of the quality of articles.[35] Ar
ticles are rated by WikiProjects. The range of quality classes begins with "Stub" (very short pages), followed by "Start", "C" and "B" (in inc
reasing order of quality). Community peer review is needed for the article to enter one of the highest quality classes: either "good article",
 "A" or the highest, "featured article". Of the about 4.4 million articles and lists assessed as of March 2015, a little more than 5,000 (0.12
%) are featured articles, and fewer than 2,000 (0.04%) are featured lists. One featured article per day, as selected by editors, appears on th
e main page of Wikipedia.[36][37]

The articles can also be rated as per "importance" as judged by a WikiProject. Currently, there are 5 importance categories: "low", "mid", "hi
gh", "top", and "???" for unclassified/uncertain level. For a particular article, different WikiProjects may assign different importance level
s.

The Wikipedia Version 1.0 Editorial Team has developed a table (shown below) that displays data of all rated articles by quality and importanc
e, on the English Wikipedia. If an article or list receives different ratings by two or more WikiProjects, then the highest rating is used in 
the table, pie-charts, and bar-chart. The software regularly auto-updates the data.

Researcher Giacomo Poderi found that articles tend to reach featured status via the intensive work of a few editors.[38] A 2010 study found un
evenness in quality among featured articles and concluded that the community process is ineffective in assessing the quality of articles.[39]

Automatic quality assessment of Wikipedia articles is a known and wide scientific problem.[41] For example, as measures for assessing quality,
 it can be taken into the account number of the references, text length, number of images, sections, articles popularity and others.[42]

WikipediaSignpostIcon.svg

Community-produced news publications include The Signpost.[7] The Signpost (previously known as The Wikipedia Signpost[47]) is the English Wik
ipedia's newspaper.[7][48][49] It is managed by the Wikipedia community and is published online weekly.[7][50] Each edition contains stories a
nd articles related to the Wikipedia community.[51][52] A wide range of editors contribute articles and other pieces.[7]

The publication was founded in January 2005 by Wikipedia administrator and later Chair of the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees, Michael 
Snow.[7][47][53] Originally titled The Wikipedia Signpost, it was later shortened to simply The Signpost.[47][54] The newspaper reports on Wik
ipedia events including Arbitration Committee rulings,[55] Wikimedia Foundation issues,[56] and other Wikipedia-related projects.[57] Snow con
tinued to contribute as a writer to The Signpost until his appointment to the Board of Trustees of the Wikimedia Foundation in February 2008.[
58]

Investigative journalism by The Signpost in 2015 on changes to freedom of panorama copyright restrictions in Europe was covered by publication
s in multiple languages including German,[59] Italian,[60] Polish,[61] and Russian.[62] Wikipedia users Gamaliel and Go Phightins! became edit
ors-in-chief of The Signpost in January 2015; prior editor-in-chief The ed17 noted that during his tenure the publication expanded its scope b
y including more reporting on the wider Wikimedia movement and English Wikipedia itself.[63] In a letter to readers upon the newspaper's tenth
 anniversary, the new co-editors-in-chief stressed the importance of maintaining independence from the Wikimedia Foundation in their reporting
.[64]

The Signpost has been the subject of academic analysis in publications including Sociological Forum,[65] the social movements journal Interfac
e,[66] and New Review of Academic Librarianship;[67] and was consulted for data on Wikipedia by researchers from Los Alamos National Laborator
y and Dartmouth College.[68] It has garnered generally positive reception from media publications including The New York Times,[69] The Regist
er,[70] Nonprofit Quarterly,[71] and Heise Online.[72] The book Wikipedia: The Missing Manual called The Signpost essential reading for ambiti
ous new Wikipedia editors.[73]

Other past and present community news publications include the "WikiWorld" web comic, the Wikipedia Weekly podcast, and newsletters of specifi
c WikiProjects like The Bugle from WikiProject Military History and the monthly newsletter from The Guild of Copy Editors. There are also a nu
mber of publications from the Wikimedia Foundation and multilingual publications such as the Wikimedia Blog and This Month in Education.

There is controversy over who founded Wikipedia. Wales considers himself to be the sole founder of Wikipedia and has told the Boston Globe tha
t "it's preposterous" to call Sanger the co-founder.[citation needed] However, Sanger strongly contests that description. He was identified as
 a co-founder of Wikipedia as early as September 2001 and referred to himself as being founder as early as January 2002.[citation needed]

The English Wikipedia is the English-language edition of the free online encyclo
pedia Wikipedia. Founded on 15 January 2001, it is the first edition of Wikipedi
a and, as of November 2017, has the most articles of any of the editions.[2] As 
of February 2019, 12% of articles in all Wikipedias belong to the English-langua
ge edition. This share has gradually declined from more than 50 percent in 2003,
 due to the growth of Wikipedias in other languages.[3] As of 21 February 2019, 
there are 5,809,429 articles on the site,[4] having surpassed the 5 million mark
 on 1 November 2015.[5] In October 2015, the combined text of the English Wikipe
dia's articles totalled 11.5 gigabytes when compressed.[6]

The Simple English Wikipedia is a variation in which most of the articles use on
ly basic English vocabulary. There is also the Old English (Ænglisc/Anglo-Saxon)
 Wikipedia (angwiki). Community-produced news publications include The Signpost.

Pioneering edition
See also: Wikipedia:Milestones

The English Wikipedia was the first Wikipedia edition and has remained the large
st. It has pioneered many ideas as conventions, policies or features which were 
later adopted by Wikipedia editions in some of the other languages. These ideas 
include "featured articles",[8] the neutral-point-of-view policy,[9] navigation 
templates,[10] the sorting of short "stub" articles into sub-categories,[11] dis
pute resolution mechanisms such as mediation and arbitration,[12] and weekly col
laborations.[13]

The English Wikipedia has adopted features from Wikipedias in other languages. T
hese features include verified revisions from the German Wikipedia (dewiki) and 
town population-lookup templates from the Dutch Wikipedia (nlwiki).

Although the English Wikipedia stores images and audio files, as well as text fi
les, many of the images have been moved to Wikimedia Commons with the same name,
 as passed-through files. However, the English Wikipedia also has fair-use image
s and audio/video files (with copyright restrictions), most of which are not all
owed on Commons.

Many of the most active participants in the Wikimedia Foundation, and the develo
pers of the MediaWiki software that powers Wikipedia, are English users.
Users and editors
English Wikipedia statistics Number of user accounts 	Number of articles 	
Number of files 	Number of administrators
35,722,435 	5,809,429 	880,889 	1,186

The English Wikipedia reached 4,000,000 registered user accounts on 1 April 2007
,[14] just a little over a year since it had crossed a threshold of 1,000,000 re
gistered user accounts in late February 2006.[15]

Over 800,000 editors have edited Wikipedia more than 10 times.[16] 300,000 edito
rs edit Wikipedia every month;[citation needed] of these, over 30,000 perform mo
re than 5 edits per month, and a little over 3,000 perform more than 100 edits p
er month.[17] By 24 November 2011, a total of 500 million edits had been perform
ed on the English Wikipedia.[citation needed]

As the largest Wikipedia edition, and because English is such a widely used lang
uage, the English Wikipedia draws many users and editors whose native language i
s not English. Such users may seek information from the English Wikipedia rather
 than the Wikipedia of their native language because the English Wikipedia tends
 to contain more information about general subjects. Successful collaborations h
ave been developed between non-native English speakers who successfully add cont
ent to the English Wikipedia and native English speakers who act as copyeditors 
for them.[citation needed]
Arbitration committee
Main article: Arbitration Committee

The English Wikipedia has an arbitration committee (also known as ArbCom) that c
onsists of a panel of editors that imposes binding rulings with regard to disput
es between other editors of the online encyclopedia.[18] The committee was creat
ed by Jimmy Wales on 4 December 2003 as an extension of the decision-making powe
r he had formerly held as owner of the site.[19][20]

When initially founded, the committee consisted of 12 arbitrators divided into t
hree groups of four members each.[19][21] Since then, the committee has graduall
y expanded its membership to 18 arbitrators.[22][not in citation given]

As with other aspects of the English Wikipedia, some of Wikipedia's sister proje
cts have emulated the arbitration committee with their own similar versions.[23]
 For instance, in 2007, an arbitration committee was founded on the German Wikip
edia called the Schiedsgericht [de].[24]
Controversies
Main article: Criticism of Wikipedia
See also: Wikipedia Seigenthaler biography incident and Essjay controversy
Threats against high schools

Several incidents of threats of violence against high schools on Wikipedia have 
been reported in the mainstream press.[25][26][27] The Glen A. Wilson High Schoo
l was the subject of such a threat in 2008,[25][26][27] and a 14-year-old was ar
rested for making a threat against Niles West High School on Wikipedia in 2006.[
28]
Disputed articles

A 2013 study from Oxford University concluded that the most disputed articles on
 the English Wikipedia tended to be broader issues, while on other language Wiki
pedias the most disputed articles tended to be regional issues; this is due to t
he English language's status as a global lingua franca, which means that many wh
o edit the English Wikipedia do not speak English as a native language.[clarific
ation needed] The study stated that the most disputed entries on the English Wik
ipedia were: George W. Bush, anarchism, Muhammad, list of WWE personnel, global 
warming, circumcision, United States, Jesus, race and intelligence, and Christia
nity.[29]
Varieties of English

One controversy in the English Wikipedia concerns which national variety of the 
English language is to be preferred, with the most commonly advocated candidates
 being American English and British English.[30] Perennial suggestions range fro
m standardizing upon a single form of English to forking the English Wikipedia p
roject. A style guideline states, "the English Wikipedia has no general preferen
ce for a major national variety of the language" and "an article on a topic that
 has strong ties to a particular English-speaking nation uses the appropriate va
riety of English for that nation".[31] An article should use spelling and gramma
r variants consistently; for example, color and colour are not to be used in the
 same article, since they represent American and British English, respectively. 
The guide also states that an article must remain in its original national varia
nt.

There has been a similar issue in the Chinese-language Wikipedia concerning regi
onal differences in writing. Efforts toward a language fork for Portuguese Wikip
edia have failed, but those regarding Norwegian Wikipedia succeeded.

Andrew Lih wrote that the English Wikipedia "didn't have the chance to go throug
h a debate over whether there should be a British English Wikipedia or an Americ
an English Wikipedia" because the English Wikipedia was the original edition.[32
][clarification needed] Editors agreed to use U.S. spellings for primarily Ameri
can topics and British spellings for primarily British topics. In 2009 Lih wrote
, "No doubt, American spellings tend to dominate by default just because of shee
r numbers."[33]
Wikiprojects, and assessments of articles' importance and quality
Main article: WikiProject

A "WikiProject" is a group of contributors who want to work together as a team t
o improve Wikipedia. These groups often focus on a specific topic area (for exam
ple, women's history), a specific location or a specific kind of task (for examp
le, checking newly created pages). The English Wikipedia currently has over 2,00
0 WikiProjects and activity varies.[34]

In 2007, in preparation for producing a print version, the English Wikipedia int
roduced an assessment scale of the quality of articles.[35] Articles are rated b
y WikiProjects. The range of quality classes begins with "Stub" (very short page
s), followed by "Start", "C" and "B" (in increasing order of quality). Community
 peer review is needed for the article to enter one of the highest quality class
es: either "good article", "A" or the highest, "featured article". Of the about 
4.4 million articles and lists assessed as of March 2015, a little more than 5,0
00 (0.12%) are featured articles, and fewer than 2,000 (0.04%) are featured list
s. One featured article per day, as selected by editors, appears on the main pag
e of Wikipedia.[36][37]

The articles can also be rated as per "importance" as judged by a WikiProject. C
urrently, there are 5 importance categories: "low", "mid", "high", "top", and "?
??" for unclassified/uncertain level. For a particular article, different WikiPr
ojects may assign different importance levels.

The Wikipedia Version 1.0 Editorial Team has developed a table (shown below) tha
t displays data of all rated articles by quality and importance, on the English 
Wikipedia. If an article or list receives different ratings by two or more WikiP
rojects, then the highest rating is used in the table, pie-charts, and bar-chart
. The software regularly auto-updates the data.

Researcher Giacomo Poderi found that articles tend to reach featured status via 
the intensive work of a few editors.[38] A 2010 study found unevenness in qualit
y among featured articles and concluded that the community process is ineffectiv
e in assessing the quality of articles.[39]

Automatic quality assessment of Wikipedia articles is a known and wide scientifi
c problem.[41] For example, as measures for assessing quality, it can be taken i
nto the account number of the references, text length, number of images, section
s, articles popularity and others.[42]

WikipediaSignpostIcon.svg

Community-produced news publications include The Signpost.[7] The Signpost (prev
iously known as The Wikipedia Signpost[47]) is the English Wikipedia's newspaper
.[7][48][49] It is managed by the Wikipedia community and is published online we
ekly.[7][50] Each edition contains stories and articles related to the Wikipedia
 community.[51][52] A wide range of editors contribute articles and other pieces
.[7]

The publication was founded in January 2005 by Wikipedia administrator and later
 Chair of the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees, Michael Snow.[7][47][53] O
riginally titled The Wikipedia Signpost, it was later shortened to simply The Si
gnpost.[47][54] The newspaper reports on Wikipedia events including Arbitration 
Committee rulings,[55] Wikimedia Foundation issues,[56] and other Wikipedia-rela
ted projects.[57] Snow continued to contribute as a writer to The Signpost until
 his appointment to the Board of Trustees of the Wikimedia Foundation in Februar
y 2008.[58]

Investigative journalism by The Signpost in 2015 on changes to freedom of panora
ma copyright restrictions in Europe was covered by publications in multiple lang
uages including German,[59] Italian,[60] Polish,[61] and Russian.[62] Wikipedia 
users Gamaliel and Go Phightins! became editors-in-chief of The Signpost in Janu
ary 2015; prior editor-in-chief The ed17 noted that during his tenure the public
ation expanded its scope by including more reporting on the wider Wikimedia move
ment and English Wikipedia itself.[63] In a letter to readers upon the newspaper
's tenth anniversary, the new co-editors-in-chief stressed the importance of mai
ntaining independence from the Wikimedia Foundation in their reporting.[64]

The Signpost has been the subject of academic analysis in publications including
 Sociological Forum,[65] the social movements journal Interface,[66] and New Rev
iew of Academic Librarianship;[67] and was consulted for data on Wikipedia by re
searchers from Los Alamos National Laboratory and Dartmouth College.[68] It has 
garnered generally positive reception from media publications including The New 
York Times,[69] The Register,[70] Nonprofit Quarterly,[71] and Heise Online.[72]
 The book Wikipedia: The Missing Manual called The Signpost essential reading fo
r ambitious new Wikipedia editors.[73]

Other past and present community news publications include the "WikiWorld" web c
omic, the Wikipedia Weekly podcast, and newsletters of specific WikiProjects lik
e The Bugle from WikiProject Military History and the monthly newsletter from Th
e Guild of Copy Editors. There are also a number of publications from the Wikime
dia Foundation and multilingual publications such as the Wikimedia Blog and This
 Month in Education.

Footnotes

There is controversy over who founded Wikipedia. Wales considers himself to be t
he sole founder of Wikipedia and has told the Boston Globe that "it's prepostero
us" to call Sanger the co-founder.[citation needed] However, Sanger strongly con
tests that description. He was identified as a co-founder of Wikipedia as early 
as September 2001 and referred to himself as being founder as early as January 2
002.[citation needed]

The English Wikipedia is the English-language edition of the free online encyclo
pedia Wikipedia. Founded on 15 January 2001, it is the first edition of Wikipedi
a and, as of November 2017, has the most articles of any of the editions.[2] As 
of February 2019, 12% of articles in all Wikipedias belong to the English-langua
ge edition. This share has gradually declined from more than 50 percent in 2003,
 due to the growth of Wikipedias in other languages.[3] As of 21 February 2019, 
there are 5,809,429 articles on the site,[4] having surpassed the 5 million mark
 on 1 November 2015.[5] In October 2015, the combined text of the English Wikipe
dia's articles totalled 11.5 gigabytes when compressed.[6]

The Simple English Wikipedia is a variation in which most of the articles use on
ly basic English vocabulary. There is also the Old English (Ænglisc/Anglo-Saxon)
 Wikipedia (angwiki). Community-produced news publications include The Signpost.

Pioneering edition
See also: Wikipedia:Milestones

The English Wikipedia was the first Wikipedia edition and has remained the large
st. It has pioneered many ideas as conventions, policies or features which were 
later adopted by Wikipedia editions in some of the other languages. These ideas 
include "featured articles",[8] the neutral-point-of-view policy,[9] navigation 
templates,[10] the sorting of short "stub" articles into sub-categories,[11] dis
pute resolution mechanisms such as mediation and arbitration,[12] and weekly col
laborations.[13]

The English Wikipedia has adopted features from Wikipedias in other languages. T
hese features include verified revisions from the German Wikipedia (dewiki) and 
town population-lookup templates from the Dutch Wikipedia (nlwiki).

Although the English Wikipedia stores images and audio files, as well as text fi
les, many of the images have been moved to Wikimedia Commons with the same name,
 as passed-through files. However, the English Wikipedia also has fair-use image
s and audio/video files (with copyright restrictions), most of which are not all
owed on Commons.

Many of the most active participants in the Wikimedia Foundation, and the develo
pers of the MediaWiki software that powers Wikipedia, are English users.
Users and editors
English Wikipedia statistics Number of user accounts 	Number of articles 	
Number of files 	Number of administrators
35,722,435 	5,809,429 	880,889 	1,186

The English Wikipedia reached 4,000,000 registered user accounts on 1 April 2007
,[14] just a little over a year since it had crossed a threshold of 1,000,000 re
gistered user accounts in late February 2006.[15]

Over 800,000 editors have edited Wikipedia more than 10 times.[16] 300,000 edito
rs edit Wikipedia every month;[citation needed] of these, over 30,000 perform mo
re than 5 edits per month, and a little over 3,000 perform more than 100 edits p
er month.[17] By 24 November 2011, a total of 500 million edits had been perform
ed on the English Wikipedia.[citation needed]

As the largest Wikipedia edition, and because English is such a widely used lang
uage, the English Wikipedia draws many users and editors whose native language i
s not English. Such users may seek information from the English Wikipedia rather
 than the Wikipedia of their native language because the English Wikipedia tends
 to contain more information about general subjects. Successful collaborations h
ave been developed between non-native English speakers who successfully add cont
ent to the English Wikipedia and native English speakers who act as copyeditors 
for them.[citation needed]
Arbitration committee
Main article: Arbitration Committee

The English Wikipedia has an arbitration committee (also known as ArbCom) that c
onsists of a panel of editors that imposes binding rulings with regard to disput
es between other editors of the online encyclopedia.[18] The committee was creat
ed by Jimmy Wales on 4 December 2003 as an extension of the decision-making powe
r he had formerly held as owner of the site.[19][20]

When initially founded, the committee consisted of 12 arbitrators divided into t
hree groups of four members each.[19][21] Since then, the committee has graduall
y expanded its membership to 18 arbitrators.[22][not in citation given]

As with other aspects of the English Wikipedia, some of Wikipedia's sister proje
cts have emulated the arbitration committee with their own similar versions.[23]
 For instance, in 2007, an arbitration committee was founded on the German Wikip
edia called the Schiedsgericht [de].[24]
Controversies
Main article: Criticism of Wikipedia
See also: Wikipedia Seigenthaler biography incident and Essjay controversy
Threats against high schools

Several incidents of threats of violence against high schools on Wikipedia have 
been reported in the mainstream press.[25][26][27] The Glen A. Wilson High Schoo
l was the subject of such a threat in 2008,[25][26][27] and a 14-year-old was ar
rested for making a threat against Niles West High School on Wikipedia in 2006.[
28]
Disputed articles

A 2013 study from Oxford University concluded that the most disputed articles on
 the English Wikipedia tended to be broader issues, while on other language Wiki
pedias the most disputed articles tended to be regional issues; this is due to t
he English language's status as a global lingua franca, which means that many wh
o edit the English Wikipedia do not speak English as a native language.[clarific
ation needed] The study stated that the most disputed entries on the English Wik
ipedia were: George W. Bush, anarchism, Muhammad, list of WWE personnel, global 
warming, circumcision, United States, Jesus, race and intelligence, and Christia
nity.[29]
Varieties of English

One controversy in the English Wikipedia concerns which national variety of the 
English language is to be preferred, with the most commonly advocated candidates
 being American English and British English.[30] Perennial suggestions range fro
m standardizing upon a single form of English to forking the English Wikipedia p
roject. A style guideline states, "the English Wikipedia has no general preferen
ce for a major national variety of the language" and "an article on a topic that
 has strong ties to a particular English-speaking nation uses the appropriate va
riety of English for that nation".[31] An article should use spelling and gramma
r variants consistently; for example, color and colour are not to be used in the
 same article, since they represent American and British English, respectively. 
The guide also states that an article must remain in its original national varia
nt.

There has been a similar issue in the Chinese-language Wikipedia concerning regi
onal differences in writing. Efforts toward a language fork for Portuguese Wikip
edia have failed, but those regarding Norwegian Wikipedia succeeded.

Andrew Lih wrote that the English Wikipedia "didn't have the chance to go throug
h a debate over whether there should be a British English Wikipedia or an Americ
an English Wikipedia" because the English Wikipedia was the original edition.[32
][clarification needed] Editors agreed to use U.S. spellings for primarily Ameri
can topics and British spellings for primarily British topics. In 2009 Lih wrote
, "No doubt, American spellings tend to dominate by default just because of shee
r numbers."[33]
Wikiprojects, and assessments of articles' importance and quality
Main article: WikiProject

A "WikiProject" is a group of contributors who want to work together as a team t
o improve Wikipedia. These groups often focus on a specific topic area (for exam
ple, women's history), a specific location or a specific kind of task (for examp
le, checking newly created pages). The English Wikipedia currently has over 2,00
0 WikiProjects and activity varies.[34]

In 2007, in preparation for producing a print version, the English Wikipedia int
roduced an assessment scale of the quality of articles.[35] Articles are rated b
y WikiProjects. The range of quality classes begins with "Stub" (very short page
s), followed by "Start", "C" and "B" (in increasing order of quality). Community
 peer review is needed for the article to enter one of the highest quality class
es: either "good article", "A" or the highest, "featured article". Of the about 
4.4 million articles and lists assessed as of March 2015, a little more than 5,0
00 (0.12%) are featured articles, and fewer than 2,000 (0.04%) are featured list
s. One featured article per day, as selected by editors, appears on the main pag
e of Wikipedia.[36][37]

The articles can also be rated as per "importance" as judged by a WikiProject. C
urrently, there are 5 importance categories: "low", "mid", "high", "top", and "?
??" for unclassified/uncertain level. For a particular article, different WikiPr
ojects may assign different importance levels.

The Wikipedia Version 1.0 Editorial Team has developed a table (shown below) tha
t displays data of all rated articles by quality and importance, on the English 
Wikipedia. If an article or list receives different ratings by two or more WikiP
rojects, then the highest rating is used in the table, pie-charts, and bar-chart
. The software regularly auto-updates the data.

Researcher Giacomo Poderi found that articles tend to reach featured status via 
the intensive work of a few editors.[38] A 2010 study found unevenness in qualit
y among featured articles and concluded that the community process is ineffectiv
e in assessing the quality of articles.[39]

Automatic quality assessment of Wikipedia articles is a known and wide scientifi
c problem.[41] For example, as measures for assessing quality, it can be taken i
nto the account number of the references, text length, number of images, section
s, articles popularity and others.[42]

WikipediaSignpostIcon.svg

Community-produced news publications include The Signpost.[7] The Signpost (prev
iously known as The Wikipedia Signpost[47]) is the English Wikipedia's newspaper
.[7][48][49] It is managed by the Wikipedia community and is published online we
ekly.[7][50] Each edition contains stories and articles related to the Wikipedia
 community.[51][52] A wide range of editors contribute articles and other pieces
.[7]

The publication was founded in January 2005 by Wikipedia administrator and later
 Chair of the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees, Michael Snow.[7][47][53] O
riginally titled The Wikipedia Signpost, it was later shortened to simply The Si
gnpost.[47][54] The newspaper reports on Wikipedia events including Arbitration 
Committee rulings,[55] Wikimedia Foundation issues,[56] and other Wikipedia-rela
ted projects.[57] Snow continued to contribute as a writer to The Signpost until
 his appointment to the Board of Trustees of the Wikimedia Foundation in Februar
y 2008.[58]

Investigative journalism by The Signpost in 2015 on changes to freedom of panora
ma copyright restrictions in Europe was covered by publications in multiple lang
uages including German,[59] Italian,[60] Polish,[61] and Russian.[62] Wikipedia 
users Gamaliel and Go Phightins! became editors-in-chief of The Signpost in Janu
ary 2015; prior editor-in-chief The ed17 noted that during his tenure the public
ation expanded its scope by including more reporting on the wider Wikimedia move
ment and English Wikipedia itself.[63] In a letter to readers upon the newspaper
's tenth anniversary, the new co-editors-in-chief stressed the importance of mai
ntaining independence from the Wikimedia Foundation in their reporting.[64]

The Signpost has been the subject of academic analysis in publications including
 Sociological Forum,[65] the social movements journal Interface,[66] and New Rev
iew of Academic Librarianship;[67] and was consulted for data on Wikipedia by re
searchers from Los Alamos National Laboratory and Dartmouth College.[68] It has 
garnered generally positive reception from media publications including The New 
York Times,[69] The Register,[70] Nonprofit Quarterly,[71] and Heise Online.[72]
 The book Wikipedia: The Missing Manual called The Signpost essential reading fo
r ambitious new Wikipedia editors.[73]

Other past and present community news publications include the "WikiWorld" web c
omic, the Wikipedia Weekly podcast, and newsletters of specific WikiProjects lik
e The Bugle from WikiProject Military History and the monthly newsletter from Th
e Guild of Copy Editors. There are also a number of publications from the Wikime
dia Foundation and multilingual publications such as the Wikimedia Blog and This
 Month in Education.

Footnotes

There is controversy over who founded Wikipedia. Wales considers himself to be t
he sole founder of Wikipedia and has told the Boston Globe that "it's prepostero
us" to call Sanger the co-founder.[citation needed] However, Sanger strongly con
tests that description. He was identified as a co-founder of Wikipedia as early 
as September 2001 and referred to himself as being founder as early as January 2
002.[citation needed]

er month.[17] By 24 November 2011, a total of 500 million edits had been perform
ed on the English Wikipedia.[citation needed]

As the largest Wikipedia edition, and because English is such a widely used lang
uage, the English Wikipedia draws many users and editors whose native language i
s not English. Such users may seek information from the English Wikipedia rather
 than the Wikipedia of their native language because the English Wikipedia tends
 to contain more information about general subjects. Successful collaborations h
ave been developed between non-native English speakers who successfully add cont
ent to the English Wikipedia and native English speakers who act as copyeditors 
for them.[citation needed]
Arbitration committee
Main article: Arbitration Committee

The English Wikipedia has an arbitration committee (also known as ArbCom) that c
onsists of a panel of editors that imposes binding rulings with regard to disput
es between other editors of the online encyclopedia.[18] The committee was creat
ed by Jimmy Wales on 4 December 2003 as an extension of the decision-making powe
r he had formerly held as owner of the site.[19][20]

When initially founded, the committee consisted of 12 arbitrators divided into t
hree groups of four members each.[19][21] Since then, the committee has graduall
y expanded its membership to 18 arbitrators.[22][not in citation given]

As with other aspects of the English Wikipedia, some of Wikipedia's sister proje
cts have emulated the arbitration committee with their own similar versions.[23]
 For instance, in 2007, an arbitration committee was founded on the German Wikip
edia called the Schiedsgericht [de].[24]
Controversies
Main article: Criticism of Wikipedia
See also: Wikipedia Seigenthaler biography incident and Essjay controversy
Threats against high schools

Several incidents of threats of violence against high schools on Wikipedia have 
been reported in the mainstream press.[25][26][27] The Glen A. Wilson High Schoo
l was the subject of such a threat in 2008,[25][26][27] and a 14-year-old was ar
rested for making a threat against Niles West High School on Wikipedia in 2006.[
28]
Disputed articles

A 2013 study from Oxford University concluded that the most disputed articles on
 the English Wikipedia tended to be broader issues, while on other language Wiki
pedias the most disputed articles tended to be regional issues; this is due to t
he English language's status as a global lingua franca, which means that many wh
o edit the English Wikipedia do not speak English as a native language.[clarific
ation needed] The study stated that the most disputed entries on the English Wik
ipedia were: George W. Bush, anarchism, Muhammad, list of WWE personnel, global 
warming, circumcision, United States, Jesus, race and intelligence, and Christia
nity.[29]
Varieties of English

One controversy in the English Wikipedia concerns which national variety of the 
English language is to be preferred, with the most commonly advocated candidates
 being American English and British English.[30] Perennial suggestions range fro
m standardizing upon a single form of English to forking the English Wikipedia p
roject. A style guideline states, "the English Wikipedia has no general preferen
ce for a major national variety of the language" and "an article on a topic that
 has strong ties to a particular English-speaking nation uses the appropriate va
riety of English for that nation".[31] An article should use spelling and gramma
r variants consistently; for example, color and colour are not to be used in the
 same article, since they represent American and British English, respectively. 
The guide also states that an article must remain in its original national varia
nt.

There has been a similar issue in the Chinese-language Wikipedia concerning regi
onal differences in writing. Efforts toward a language fork for Portuguese Wikip
edia have failed, but those regarding Norwegian Wikipedia succeeded.

Andrew Lih wrote that the English Wikipedia "didn't have the chance to go throug
h a debate over whether there should be a British English Wikipedia or an Americ
an English Wikipedia" because the English Wikipedia was the original edition.[32
][clarification needed] Editors agreed to use U.S. spellings for primarily Ameri
can topics and British spellings for primarily British topics. In 2009 Lih wrote
, "No doubt, American spellings tend to dominate by default just because of shee
r numbers."[33]
Wikiprojects, and assessments of articles' importance and quality
Main article: WikiProject

A "WikiProject" is a group of contributors who want to work together as a team t
o improve Wikipedia. These groups often focus on a specific topic area (for exam
ple, women's history), a specific location or a specific kind of task (for examp
le, checking newly created pages). The English Wikipedia currently has over 2,00
0 WikiProjects and activity varies.[34]

In 2007, in preparation for producing a print version, the English Wikipedia int
roduced an assessment scale of the quality of articles.[35] Articles are rated b
y WikiProjects. The range of quality classes begins with "Stub" (very short page
s), followed by "Start", "C" and "B" (in increasing order of quality). Community
 peer review is needed for the article to enter one of the highest quality class
es: either "good article", "A" or the highest, "featured article". Of the about 
4.4 million articles and lists assessed as of March 2015, a little more than 5,0
00 (0.12%) are featured articles, and fewer than 2,000 (0.04%) are featured list
s. One featured article per day, as selected by editors, appears on the main pag
e of Wikipedia.[36][37]

The articles can also be rated as per "importance" as judged by a WikiProject. C
urrently, there are 5 importance categories: "low", "mid", "high", "top", and "?
??" for unclassified/uncertain level. For a particular article, different WikiPr
ojects may assign different importance levels.

The Wikipedia Version 1.0 Editorial Team has developed a table (shown below) tha
t displays data of all rated articles by quality and importance, on the English 
Wikipedia. If an article or list receives different ratings by two or more WikiP
rojects, then the highest rating is used in the table, pie-charts, and bar-chart
. The software regularly auto-updates the data.

Researcher Giacomo Poderi found that articles tend to reach featured status via 
the intensive work of a few editors.[38] A 2010 study found unevenness in qualit
y among featured articles and concluded that the community process is ineffectiv
e in assessing the quality of articles.[39]

Automatic quality assessment of Wikipedia articles is a known and wide scientifi
c problem.[41] For example, as measures for assessing quality, it can be taken i
nto the account number of the references, text length, number of images, section
s, articles popularity and others.[42]

Internal news publications
See also: The Signpost
WikipediaSignpostIcon.svg

Community-produced news publications include The Signpost.[7] The Signpost (prev
iously known as The Wikipedia Signpost[47]) is the English Wikipedia's newspaper
.[7][48][49] It is managed by the Wikipedia community and is published online we
ekly.[7][50] Each edition contains stories and articles related to the Wikipedia
 community.[51][52] A wide range of editors contribute articles and other pieces
.[7]

The publication was founded in January 2005 by Wikipedia administrator and later
 Chair of the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees, Michael Snow.[7][47][53] O
riginally titled The Wikipedia Signpost, it was later shortened to simply The Si
gnpost.[47][54] The newspaper reports on Wikipedia events including Arbitration 
Committee rulings,[55] Wikimedia Foundation issues,[56] and other Wikipedia-rela
ted projects.[57] Snow continued to contribute as a writer to The Signpost until
 his appointment to the Board of Trustees of the Wikimedia Foundation in Februar
y 2008.[58]

Investigative journalism by The Signpost in 2015 on changes to freedom of panora
ma copyright restrictions in Europe was covered by publications in multiple lang
uages including German,[59] Italian,[60] Polish,[61] and Russian.[62] Wikipedia 
users Gamaliel and Go Phightins! became editors-in-chief of The Signpost in Janu
ary 2015; prior editor-in-chief The ed17 noted that during his tenure the public
ation expanded its scope by including more reporting on the wider Wikimedia move
ment and English Wikipedia itself.[63] In a letter to readers upon the newspaper
's tenth anniversary, the new co-editors-in-chief stressed the importance of mai
ntaining independence from the Wikimedia Foundation in their reporting.[64]

The Signpost has been the subject of academic analysis in publications including
 Sociological Forum,[65] the social movements journal Interface,[66] and New Rev
iew of Academic Librarianship;[67] and was consulted for data on Wikipedia by re
searchers from Los Alamos National Laboratory and Dartmouth College.[68] It has 
garnered generally positive reception from media publications including The New 
York Times,[69] The Register,[70] Nonprofit Quarterly,[71] and Heise Online.[72]
 The book Wikipedia: The Missing Manual called The Signpost essential reading fo
r ambitious new Wikipedia editors.[73]

Other past and present community news publications include the "WikiWorld" web c
omic, the Wikipedia Weekly podcast, and newsletters of specific WikiProjects lik
e The Bugle from WikiProject Military History and the monthly newsletter from Th
e Guild of Copy Editors. There are also a number of publications from the Wikime
dia Foundation and multilingual publications such as the Wikimedia Blog and This
 Month in Education.

There is controversy over who founded Wikipedia. Wales considers himself to be t
he sole founder of Wikipedia and has told the Boston Globe that "it's prepostero
us" to call Sanger the co-founder.[citation needed] However, Sanger strongly con
tests that description. He was identified as a co-founder of Wikipedia as early 
as September 2001 and referred to himself as being founder as early as January 2
002.[citation needed]

The English Wikipedia was the first Wikipedia edition and has remained the large
st. It has pioneered many ideas as conventions, policies or features which were 
later adopted by Wikipedia editions in some of the other languages. These ideas 
include "featured articles",[8] the neutral-point-of-view policy,[9] navigation 
templates,[10] the sorting of short "stub" articles into sub-categories,[11] dis
pute resolution mechanisms such as mediation and arbitration,[12] and weekly col
laborations.[13]

The English Wikipedia has adopted features from Wikipedias in other languages. T
hese features include verified revisions from the German Wikipedia (dewiki) and 
town population-lookup templates from the Dutch Wikipedia (nlwiki).

Although the English Wikipedia stores images and audio files, as well as text fi
les, many of the images have been moved to Wikimedia Commons with the same name,
 as passed-through files. However, the English Wikipedia also has fair-use image
s and audio/video files (with copyright restrictions), most of which are not all
owed on Commons.

Many of the most active participants in the Wikimedia Foundation, and the develo
pers of the MediaWiki software that powers Wikipedia, are English users.

The English Wikipedia is the English-language edition of the free online encyclo
pedia Wikipedia. Founded on 15 January 2001, it is the first edition of Wikipedi
a and, as of November 2017, has the most articles of any of the editions.[2] As 
of February 2019, 12% of articles in all Wikipedias belong to the English-langua
ge edition. This share has gradually declined from more than 50 percent in 2003,
 due to the growth of Wikipedias in other languages.[3] As of 21 February 2019, 
there are 5,809,429 articles on the site,[4] having surpassed the 5 million mark
 on 1 November 2015.[5] In October 2015, the combined text of the English Wikipe
